        <p class="p1">Oh I remember, how we used to fight endlessly<br>
            As if we were destined to be enemies<br>
            Yet through the years, with you I share<br>
            Some of life’s best memories<br>
            We may fight and argue like cats and dogs<br>
            But no one can keep me sane like you do<br>
            Nothing in the whole world, nothing at all<br>
            Can come close to the bond I have with you<br>
            Going through life’s manic phases<br>
            In words, I just cannot be described<br>
            To see me through all the tough times<br>
            A sister like you, is what fate prescribed.
            
        </p>
        <p class="p1">
            Someone, who can sense when I’m in doubt<br> 
            Someone, who believes in me no matter what<br>
            Someone, who knows me inside out<br>
            That someone, I often take for granted<br>
            That someone, is an angel in disguise<br>
            A friend, a mentor and much more<br>
            She is my sister, my life’s biggest prize<br>
